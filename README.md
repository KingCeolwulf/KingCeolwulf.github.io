# KingCeolwulf.github.io

The code originally to generate [this page](https://kingceolwulf.github.io/)
Now building test versions of a game [here](https://kingceolwulf.github.io/meteors-godot.html)

This is a testing ground for using [Idyll](https://idyll-lang.org/) and [Apparatus](http://aprt.us/)
to build interactive math/algebra lessons.

Hopefully much more to come in the future!
